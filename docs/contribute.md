# How to Contribute to the Repository

We welcome neuroanatomists and other experts to further refine these segmentations, delineate additional ROIs, segment existing ROIs based on alternate research-based interpretations of best practice, etc, and make your updated data available on our open repository. To contribute, please follow the steps below.

## Current System

### Fill out a google form with your information

This form will ask for your name/group and institution, what changes/additions you have made, where researchers can find documentation on your data and/or segmentation protocol, and how you plan to send your contributions to MIDB.

[Submit a BOBs Repository Contribution](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdppXSfL7RZ2jxo5t8ufh2jZ5tgNLaAKb5pzfOJ8md9F22PsQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Send your data/segmentations to MIDB

Data and segmentations **must** be in [BIDS format](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) and connected to DataLad (Documentation on connecting to DataLab will be linked here soon). 

To send your data/segmentations, we currently recommend a link to a Box folder. MIDB will upload the data to the repository and link your documentation to the repository information.


## Looking Forward

Check back soon - we are working on connecting BOBs Repository to OpenNeuro so that contributions can be added automatically via the OpenNeuro system!
